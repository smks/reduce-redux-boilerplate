# Redux Demo

**Created by Shaun Stone**

My task was to build a browser-based developer portal in JavaScript against a dummy API.

## How to run

1. Run `npm install` in the root of the project to install the necessary external dependencies.

1. Run `npm start` to boot up the application on the port `3000` under localhost. If you have something running on this port already, don't worry, it will prompt you to choose another port.
